Run a hello world Python GitHub project and check it out and run your tests on all three clouds: AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Make a new Flask application that serves out a “hello world” type route using AWS Elastic Beanstalk you think other people would find helpful and put the code into a GitHub repo along with a screenshot of it serving out a request in the GitHub README.md. Then, create a continuous delivery process to deploy the Flask application using AWS CodeBuild.

Fork this repository that contains a Flask machine learning application and deploy it with continuous delivery on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and Code Pipeline.

Fork this repository that contains a Flask machine learning application and deploy it with continuous delivery on GCP using Google App Engine and Cloud Build or Cloud Run and Cloud Build.

Fork this repository that contains a Flask machine learning application and deploy it with continuous delivery on Azure using Azure App Services and Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Use the Traveling Salesman code example and port it to work with coordinates you grab from an API, say all of the best restaurants in a city you want to visit. You will never think about vacation the same again.

Using the TensorFlow Playground, experiment with changing the hyperparameters across different datasets as well as problem types. Can you identify optimal configurations of hidden layers, learning rate, and regularization rate for different datasets?
